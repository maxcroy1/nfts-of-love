      <p>
        Non-Fungible Tokens of Love is a creative project by Val Woulfe and Max
        Croy inspired by Halloween and the metaverse.
        <br />
        <br />
        While NFTs are having a breakthrough year, Halloweenâ€™s origins date back
        millenniums. Legend has it that on the night before Halloween the
        boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead become blurred,
        so costumes are worn to ward off ghosts. Like the blur of the undead,
        NFTs and the blockchain have left many to question a new terrifying
        blur, that of physical reality and life online.
        <br />
        <br />
        By bringing the idea of non-fungible tokens to life with our Halloween
        costumes, we aim to create an exposition of the impeding metaverse and
        the spookiness of the digitization of life and love in a new reality.
        <br />
        <br />
        To celebrate love and the gory blood of the undead, our NFT series for
        the public to mint has all proceeds going to the{" "}
