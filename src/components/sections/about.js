      <h2>What is Non-Fungible Tokens of Love?</h2>
      <p>
        Non-Fungible Tokens of Love is a project started by Max Croy and Valerie
        Woulfe after brainstorming some ideas for a couples Halloween outfit
        this year.
        <br />
        <br />
        NFTs had a breakout year in 2021, so we figured it'd be the perfect
        theme for our outfit. After thinking through a few concepts and engaging
        in some wordplay, we decided "Non-Fungible Tokens of Love" seemed to be
        a concept that rose to the occassion for a couples' outfit, and the name
        witty enough to easily justify over a few drinks at a party. Yes, we
        know it's cringey, but after letting the idea sit for a few days, we
        decided it lended itself to a lot more opportunities then just a
        fun Halloween outfit.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's why we decided to create a real NFT series for the public to mint
        with all proceeds going to the{" "}
