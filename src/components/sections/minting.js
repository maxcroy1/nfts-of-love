        Each NFT can be minted at a price of your choosing, with each mint
        resulting in the transfer of a unique Non-Fungible Token of Love to your
        ERC-721 compatible wallet (We recommend{" "}
        <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">
          MetaMask
        </a>{" "}
        based on its popularity and ease of use).
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to the time constraints faced in putting this project together in
        time, your NFT will share the artwork of others in this series. While
        the artwork for each NFT is not unique (at least this year), each NFT
        has a unique ID featured in its name to indicate its uniqueness.
